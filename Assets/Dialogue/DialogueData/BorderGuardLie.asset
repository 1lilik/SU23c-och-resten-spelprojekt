  - 'Dorian:

    We are here for business. My brother in law owns a prestigious
    organization and we are looking for a more comfortable place to live while helping
    him.'
  - "Border guard:\n Of Course sir! No worries go right ahead!"
  - The family passes through the border control.
  - "Elena:\n I did not like that man."
  - "Ivan:\n Me neither. He looked scary."
  - "Adina:\n Well, you are lucky. You will never have to meet him again."
  - "Dorian:\n And I think we are almost at our new place now. We can eat the sandwiches
    when we arrive there.\r\n"
  - "Ivan:\n Sandwiches with cheese!"
  - The family keeps walking. More and more tent-looking houses appear the further
    they walk.
